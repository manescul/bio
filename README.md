# Work experience

### January 2022 – Current
#### Software Developer | Ruby/Rails | Shopify Commerce Germany GmbH, Berlin, Germany

<table>
	<tr><th>Team</th><td>Billing / Partner Payouts</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Keywords</th><td>Ruby, Ruby On Rails, VSCode, Github</td></tr>
</table>

The Partner Payouts team is the Billing part inside Shopify that focuses on paying partners and collaborators (theme developers, app developers, merchant developers, affiliates, etc) for their collaboration. The team is strongly dependent on other billing teams and flows like Merchants Billing, Billing Infrastructure and Billing Platform.

Working outside the Core app, the daily activities consist of improving payment flows, fixing edge cases and backing up support representatives. More decoupling and improving of internal workflows are the long term goals of the team.

-----------------------------------

### November 2020 – January 2022
#### Senior Software Developer | PHP | Contorion GmbH, Berlin, Germany  

<table>
	<tr><th>Team</th><td>Payments, Fulfillment</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Keywords</th><td>Spryker, PHP 7.x, Propel, Twig, SOLID, Docker, PHPStorm, BitBucket, Gitlab</td></tr>
</table>

With focus mainly on cost optimization my first team inside the IT department focuses on payments and related flows. The daily activities consist of refactoring according to SOLID principles and (unit/integration) testing while updating mainly Klarna and Billie payment processes.  
This drove the discovery of other areas like PDP, checkout, logistics and fulfillment where I help other teams with code reviews, testing and analysis.  

The second team was the Fulfillment one, which was a perfect fit for me. Landing in a familiar role (see Wayfair), I was able to bring in past experience and worked on improving merchant communications (APIs, EDIFACT, internal Order Management platform for small merchants), stock management and warehouse api integration.

-----------------------------------

### October 2019 – October 2020
#### Senior Software Developer | PHP | Spriker Systems GmbH, Berlin, Germany

<table>
	<tr><th>Team</th><td>Enabling Services</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Keywords</th><td>Spryker Commerce OS, PHP 7.x, Silex, Propel, Twig, SOLID, Docker, PHPStorm, GitHub, Scrum</td></tr>
</table>

As the name implies, Enabling Services, I am part of the department that starts and course corrects client projects. The projects are all e-commerce and they can be placed into one of the following categories:
- Internal delivery: A Spryker team fully starts and develops the project. The team structure involves one business and one technical manager, one solution architect, BE and FE developers and QA.
- Joint team with client employees : In such projects the role is to drive the team, implement features, make sure the Spryker core concepts are followed and provide code review and guidance.
- Consultancy : Many times old clients need improvements or new features and they require help from Spryker in the form of a consultant/developer or a team of such individuals. Also, clients switching from an agency to their own need guidance to make a better transition and a similar project is spawn.

-----------------------------------

### December 2018 – September 2019
#### Senior Software Developer | PHP | Wayfair GmbH., Berlin, Germany

<table>
	<tr><th>Team</th><td>Supplier Extranet / Supplier fulfillment and performance</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Keywords</th><td>PHP 7.2, PHPUnit, MS SQL Server, PHPStorm, GitLab, Agile, Scrum</td></tr>
</table>

I was part of one big wheel in Wayfair's mechanism: the Supplier Extranet. This is the department responsible for the integration of new suppliers and the success of the existing ones. Everything is supplier centered and their success is the core value that drives the entire department. 

It applied to my team as well as we were responsible for the supplier order life cycle from after creation until fulfillment. Inside the team I did my best to learn the business, provided help and challenged my teammates to improve every little code unit. I did a constant job of refactoring, testing and overall modernization of the existing features.

The amount of information was sometimes overwhelming but there was nothing better than a good challenge every day. This was tackled easily with the help of a good SCRUM team, continuous communication and knowledge sharing. 

-----------------------------------

### October 2017 – November 2018
#### Team Lead Ops 1 | Sage Intacct, Inc., Cluj-Napoca, Romania

<table>
	<tr><th>Team</th><td>OPS1 - Backend Infrastructure</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Role</th><td>projects supervisor, scrum master, technical lead, teacher/mentor</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Reporting to</th><td>SDM, PO, Dev and QA Architects</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Team size</th><td>5 developers, 2 testers</td></tr>
</table>  

On top of my normal tasks as a senior developer, I have taken over supervising duties of the SDM and I did my best to understand and research new projects, solve external team dependencies, implement scrum best practices, track project evolution and ensure deadlines are always met.

-----------------------------------

### April 2015 – September 2017
#### Senior Software Developer | PHP | Sage Intacct, Inc., Cluj-Napoca, Romania

<table>
	<tr><th>Team</th><td>Backend Infrastructure, OPS1</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Keywords</th><td>PHP, PLSQL, ElasticSearch, PHPUnit, Win8.1/10/CentOS, PHPStorm, SQL Developer, SVN, Rally, AGILE, Scrum, Confluence</td></tr>
</table>  

Sage Intacct provides its clients with the best-in-class cloud ERP software and I am proud to have helped it do so as part of the of the RnD department. As part of the backend infrastructure team, I added value to the operations that Intacct is offering to its clients.

Always invisible to the end-user, my work meant updates and fixes for:
- administrative tools (cross DB schemas/servers management)
- Operations/DBA dept. scripts for tenant management
- providing POCs for implementing PHPUnit as unit testing framework
- providing POCs for refactoring old code and make it testable

My long term project was the implementation of multiple delivery points or separation points. This involved providing the best way to:
- deliver same application from more than one data center (or clusters inside one data center)
- add support for versioning the application and backward compatibility
- manage existing tenants within multiple data centers and versions
- manage global or “locally global” operations and states

I also started the ElasticSearch project which was meant to replace the old Oracle Text Search implementation. Even if the system is old and cling on the main app, my short term plan was to: 
- move indexed data from Oracle DB to Elastic search, freeing up to 30% of data center space
- speed up searches by using a dedicated service
- replace the old cron based document indexing with live updating of searchable information
Driven by the need to automate some long running tasks, like the creation and activation of large company trees, I learned Python and Selenium WebDriver and combined them to create my own automation tool.

### May 2014 – March 2015
#### Software Developer | C++/Qt/JavaScript | Acunetix, Cluj-Napoca, Romania
<table>
	<tr><th>Project</th><td>Login Sequence Recorder (part of the Web Vulnerability Scanner)</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Keywords</th><td>C++, QT4.8, WebKit, Win7, Visual Studio 2010, SVN (Tortoise)</td></tr>
</table>

The project was part of the Web Vulnerability Scanner and it is the tool that is being used starting with the version number ten of the scanner. It is recording and replaying user interactions with a web page in order to provide automatic login functionality. It is used by the scanner to reconnect timed out user sessions.

-----------------------------------

### July 2012 – July 2014
#### Software Developer | C++/Qt | Accenture, Cluj-Napoca, Romania
<table>
	<tr><th>Team</th><td>GUIDO (SIEMENS project) – Graphic UI with Dynamic Objects</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Keywords</th><td>C++, QT4.8, Win7, WinXP, Visual Studio 2010 , ClearCase, SVN (Tortoise), Rational Team Concert</td></tr>
</table>

The project was a general configurable user interface system with which you can create graphical user interfaces ranging from the simple dialogs to element interconnection diagrams and fully operable track layouts using OpenGL.

The concept behind it is to separate the user interface from the underlying application. To this end, it communicates with the applications through a defined interface. Its basic functionality is extended by several plug-ins enabling specific styles, custom controls or even data engineering.

My primary tasks were the implementations of the new style widgets features and fixing bugs related to the style plug-ins. The other project was an automatic test tool used to test various critical implementations of the main project. Other than implementing project specific commands, it also has an integrated low level keyboard and mouse interaction method which can be used to test different other applications.

The verification step can be done by picture in picture recognition (PNG mostly), incoming events listing or output file comparison. 

-----------------------------------

### May 2012 – July 2012
#### Software Developer | ObjectiveC | Pentalog, Iasi, Romania
<table>
	<tr><th>Team</th><td>DJUCED</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Keywords</th><td>Objective-C, iPad, iOS5, C/C++, BASS and Elastique(3rd party audio libraries), MacOS Snow Leopard, XCode 4.3, SVN (Tortoise), JIRA</td></tr>
</table>

I developed an IOS 5.1 application for the iPad (iOS5). It was an audio application for DJs meant to offer mixing possibilities. It resembled a standard mixing table offering an interface able to be controlled via USB cable by a MIDI compliant device.

-----------------------------------

### June 2011 – May 2012
#### Software Developer | C/C++ | Pentalog, Iasi, Romania / Ericsson Telekommunikation
<table>
	<tr><th>Team</th><td>BSCS iX - Call rating and billing</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Keywords</th><td>C++, Windows XP, Unix, SunStudio, ClearCase, ClearQuest</td></tr>
</table>

The project I used to work on is Ericsson’s mobile telephony product for rating, billing and support market application that covers the entire business flow, starting with the resource activation and finishing with the billing process. Its aim is to help telecom providers with both online and offline rating and billing for almost all services and covering a large type of markets.

The backend part of the project, which I worked on, was composed of independent modules written in C and C++ combining legacy code with new features. They are developed on Unix servers, SUN and HP.

-----------------------------------

### November 2007 – June 2011
#### Software Developer | C++ | Embarcadero Technologies, Iasi, Romania
<table>
	<tr><th>Team</th><td>ER/Studio Data Architect</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Keywords</th><td>C/C++, STL, MFC, Windows XP, Windows7, VisualStudio2003/2008, Perforce, JIRA/Confluence, AGILE</td></tr>
</table> 
	
The project was the data modeling tool of the Embarcadero DataGear family. Mainly used by database architects, ER/Studio DA was the main choice on the data modeling market at the moment and offered features like: logical and physical model generation, forward and backward engineering, compare and merge utility, collaborative work using the ER/Studio Repository (part of the Enterprise solution), modeling automation using VB script like language, reporting using ER/Portal. 

Being developed entirely in C++, I was able to work on almost all the project getting in contact with both, doing maintenance work, bug fixing and QA support, and new implementations as: adding SSL layer on top of the existing TCP/IP communication library, Active Directory integration using LDAP. The most challenging task was the porting of the code from VC2003 to VC2008, which implied dealing with major compiler differences and updating the third party library.

An interesting part of the project was the implementation of the CodeGear’s Zombie automation testing tool for ER/Studio. For this task I was working with another engineer using DELPHI and RAD Studio. In parallel with modeling the interaction between Zombie and ER/Studio I had to implement an easy to use interface for the QA engineers in order to write automation tests.

-----------------------------------

### April 2006 – November 2007
#### Software Developer | C++ | ArtInfo, Iasi, Romania / ArtiInformatiche, Sacile PN, Italy
<table>
	<tr><th>Team</th><td>Ideale2000, Ideale2005</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Keywords</th><td>C/C++, STL, MFC, ActiveX, Windows XP, VisualStudio 6, VisualStudio 2005, SQL Server Management Studio, MS SQL Server 2000/2005, SVN/Tortoise</td></tr>
</table>

Both products were ERP software for very large companies. The two projects were aimed to provide customers with the complete set of managing tools for almost any type of business and no matter the industry.

Role: I was part of the “Production” team working mainly on customer specific changes, designing the UI and implementing part of the business logic using C++, STL and MFC. A very important part of the development process was the update of the MS SQL Server database structure, stored procedures, functions and triggers.
